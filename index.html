                After reading this, web pages are not all-encompassing. The person designing
                a web page is like an architect designing an open space or a building. The 
                elements presented on a web page are like real buildings. In web design, HTML 
                is the "structure" of the web building, and people need to build the foundation 
                of the web page, CSS files show the presentation of the elements in the web 
                design, and JavaScript adds interactivity to the web page.

                In her article, Laurel Schwulst mentions that it is inappropriate to compare the 
                Internet to a cloud. The Internet is often fluid and changes over time. The people 
                who need to design the website should also take the responsibility that should be 
                borne in building the webpage, just like the architects will take the responsibility 
                for their design. People need to help clean and manage the web as if it were a space 
                similar to the real world.

                -“I want to challenge us all to have greater ambitions for the web. I want the web to 
                reflect our hopes and fulfill our dreams, rather than magnify our fears and deepen our 
                divisions.”
